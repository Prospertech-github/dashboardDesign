# Dashboard Design with React

## Introduction

This project is a test project for the Training phase of the NUPAT Technologies Internship. The intention of the project is to test interns ability to deliver pixel-perfect designs that match given UI design and also eye for details.

## Link To App and Design

This app is a desktop dashboard design. It was designed using Figma and developed using React.JS.

### Build Process

The app was with React and was styles using `CSS Modules`. The reason for using CSS Modules is the `Programming Concept of Separation of Concern`. 

Using CSS Modules, each component has a separate CSS Module file named with the following convention `componentName.module.css`. This file contains all component based styling.

Using React, the app was broken into independent components and developed applying some React developement logics and concepts like `props`, `conditional rendering`

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
