# Dashboard Design with React

## Introduction

This project is a test project for the Training phase of the NUPAT Technologies Internship. The intention of the project is to test interns ability to deliver pixel-perfect designs that match given UI design and also eye for details.

## Link To App and Design

This app is a desktop dashboard design. It was designed using Figma and developed using React.JS. To have a look at the app, click the link(s) below

## Build Process

The app was with React and was styles using `CSS Modules`. The reason for using CSS Modules is the `Programming Concept of Separation of Concern`. 

Using CSS Modules, each component has a separate CSS Module file named with the following convention `componentName.module.css`. This file contains all component based styling.

Using React, the app was broken into independent components and developed applying some React developement logics and concepts like `props`, `conditional rendering` etc.


## Codebase Structure

The codebase is structured in the simplest possible way using proper and clearly defined names for folders and files.

The `assets` folder holds the icons and images used in the development of the application.

The `components` folder holds the various independent components of the applications like the Cards, Icon components, Buttons, etc.

The `pages` folder holds the various parts of the Dashboard design. Though the application is currently a `Single Page Application (SPA)`, the decision to still split the Landing Page to different is a decision to tackle futuristic expansion or enhancement of the dashboard design version.


## Difficulty Encountered

The development of this apllication was a huge learning curve for me. The significant difficulty I encountered while working on the project was `Trying my possible best to make components as reusable as possible` and `Prop drilling through component children`
